				"…This game is about as basic as it gets. With computer-terminal-like graphics, no sound, and easy gameplay, this couldn’t be any more bare bones. Yet it’s the strategy and subtle hints dropped along the way that provide the challenge. …"</p>
			<p>"Such a cool idea to make a version of minesweeper. Pooping is more fun now!" -★★★★★</p>
			<p>"If you enjoy the puzzle logic of minesweeper, you're in for a real treat with this one. Same fun base, but rebooted and surprisingly modern and slick." -★★★★</p>
